# project-auto-file-manager

Whenever you download files they get saved in downloads folder or you have to manually select the folder to which location you want to save the file.
Manually selecting the location everytime you download something is pain. 
Most of them select download folder as default location. So whenever you download files, all the files in download folder become a cluter.

What this python code does is whenever u download file it automatically moves them to Documents/Videos/Music/Photos folder based on file extension.

To make this code run on your system edit line 24,50,56,62,68,75

Issues with the code:
1) whenever you download the file you cant open it from your web browser as the file doesnt exist in download folder location.
